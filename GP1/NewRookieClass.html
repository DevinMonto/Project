    <h3><u>Juraj Slafkovsky</u>j</h3>
    <p>Juraj is a 6,4 108kg player, born in Slovakia Juraj was known to be a fierce competitor rising to the leagues and ranks of the Slovakian hockey association. once he turned 18, he joined Finland's men's national club, where he lit it up. Shortly after, the Olympics for hockey came up, and Juraj would quickly make his name scoring seven goals in 7 games and leading Slovakia to the semifinals, which was very rare for them. Once the tournament was over, Juraj became known as the next big thing leading into the NHL, and as the draft night rolled by, Juraj was selected #1 overall, which is enormous, especially for the league. Although Juraj has only played a few games so far in the NHL, he's looked a little stumbly as he is not used to the pace of the NHL, but he is doing e better and is constantly getting better as each game progresses. Juraj has a wicked shot and a great set of hands for a guy who stands at 6,4. In the future, Juraj may be the face of hockey for years to come.</p>

    <h3><u>Owen power</u></h3>
    <p>Who is Owen Power? You may ask, well, to answer that Owen is the next big thing for Canada. Coming in at a whopping 6'7, Owen power is a monster on skates. Growing up in Pickering, Ontario, Owen worked his way through the ranks of the Ontario hockey league, coming out as the top guy for defence in the draft as he was not only dominating in the club but dominating nationally in other tournaments, including the u18 world cup where he recorded 12 points as a defenceman which is unheard of. This season would be Owen's first season as he was drafted two years ago in the 2021 draft class and has since played in college, lighting it up. Owen is set to have a breakout year being a powerhouse, playmaking,  puck shooting, and skilful defencemen in the NHL defiently a watch player. </p>

    <h3><u> Logan Thompson</u></h3>
    <p>Two years ago, Logan Thompson was sought to be a failed goalie playing for the university of york on their hockey teams. Now he is seen to be sought after by many teams as one of the best rookie goaltenders in the NHL. Coming in at 6'4, Logan had been drafted back in the 2018 draft near the 10th round, and for those who know, that round is where you usually know your not making it to the NHL. Everything was taking course until one day, Thompson was given a chance to play in the Western hockey league, he did, and now the rest is history. Thompson's athleticism and natural flexibility allow him to save and slide calmly and composedly. Currently playing for the vegas golden knights, Thompson has already been heating up, recording a 0.943 save percentage which is incredible to have in the NHL. If you like watching goalies, then Logan Thompson is a much watch by my standards. </p>
