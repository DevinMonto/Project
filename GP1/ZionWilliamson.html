         <blockquote>Pelicans coach Willie Green was glad to have Williamson back on the floor.

            <i>“When he touches the ball, he makes the right play, whether it's to score for himself, finding his teammates or kicking it out, setting screens, continuing to move,”</i> Green said. <i>“He was fantastic.”</i></blockquote>
         <blockquote><i>“Still a little sore, man,” Williamson said. “I've taken a lot of falls, but I ain't never had a fall like that one. But it was fine enough for me to play. Unless I'm truly injured, I'm going to be playing the game of basketball. That's just how I am.”</i></blockquote>
         <blockquote><i>“We got some special shooters on this team,”</i> Williamson said. <i>“I'm able to find them and they knock the shots down.”</i></blockquote>
