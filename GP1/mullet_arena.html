    <p>The Arizona Coyotes are put into an exciting place. They are an NHL team that can't afford to stay in their 30,000-seat arena; I know, odd, so what do they decide to do? They end up downscaling their hall to only around 5,000 fans which are entirely unheard of, mainly for an NHL team. You may think, well, why is this exciting? Well, the main reason is its location. The new arena, also known as the mullet arena, is located near the university of Arizona. So what do college kids love to do after school? Watch sports by building their arena near a college. They allow for their stands to be packed to keep a tight-knitted fan base within the arena allowing for constant support, noise and cheering while also looking good through the cameras and live television. For some, this may look like a step in the wrong direction, but for others, it can be seen as simply another power move by the general manager of the NHL, Gary Bettman.</p>
