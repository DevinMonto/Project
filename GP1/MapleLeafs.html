         <blockquote>After versing the Anaheim Ducks, they loss a very interesting game with the score being 3-4. Statistically, Anaheim Ducks were the worst team in all of the NHL. This is now their 4th loss in a row! Wait for what the players have to say about this at the post game interview.</blockquote>
